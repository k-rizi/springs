# Which String Breaks?

This repository provides the code, simulations, and manuscript for our analysis of the classic physics problem: when a vertical chain of masses connected by massless strings is pulled downward with constant acceleration, which string breaks first?

## Overview

We model the system by treating each string as an ideal spring and analyze the dynamics for one-mass (`n=1`) and two-mass (`n=2`) configurations. The study combines analytical derivations with numerical solutions for the breaking times of each string.

## Key Features

- Mathematical formulation of the mass-spring system
- Analytical solution for special cases
- Numerical simulation of breaking times as a function of acceleration
- Figures illustrating results
- LaTeX manuscript detailing the work

## Parameters Used

The default simulation parameters are:
- `k/m = 10³ s⁻²`
- `Δl = 20 mm` (breaking extension)
- `g = 9.81 m/s²` (gravitational acceleration)
